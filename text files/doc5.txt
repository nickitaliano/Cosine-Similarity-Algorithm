Abstract—This paper analyzes the relationship between
search engine hit counts and Wikipedia article views by
evaluating the cross correlation between them. We observe the
hit count estimates of three popular search engines over a month
and compare them with the Wikipedia page views. The strongest
cross correlations are recorded with their delays in days. We
present the results in both graphs and quantitative data among
different search engines. We also investigate the predicting
trends between the hit counts and Wikipedia article traffic.
Keywords—hit count estimations; search engines; Wikipedia
article traffic; cross correlation; positive delay, negative delay;
prediction of Web hosting trend
I. INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK
When a user searches for a term, the search engines return
the estimated number of Web pages related to the keyword
searched, named the search engine hit count [1]. Search engine
results are now widely used for measurement purposes in
Webometrics. Researchers have used hit counts as input for
many studies of Web information, e.g., to determine how many
pages in one country link to another [2]. Cilibrasi and Vitanyi
used search engine hit counts to measure semantic similarities
of words [3].
Wikipedia is the largest encyclopedia in existence and it is
among the fastest growing sites on the web [4]. Wikipedia has
appeared in many research papers as a valuable data source of
study. For example, Ponzetto and Strube used Wikipedia for
computing semantic relatedness [5]. Cucerzan presents a
system for the recognition and semantic disambiguation of
entities based on information extracted from Wikipedia [6]. In
the field of health information, Laurent and Vickers
investigated whether Wikipedia article traffic correlated with
epidemiological factors and compared page views statistics to a
major online health encyclopedia [7].
This paper studies the correlation between search engines’
hit counts and the Wikipedia article traffic. It also analyzes the
predicting trends between the two resources, which can be a
useful tool for business and Web publishers to promote their
websites.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the process of mining hit counts and Wikipedia
article views and describes the approach to evaluating their
correlation. In Section III, we present the results by graphing
the correlations and we investigate if traffic to Wikipedia
articles can predict the Web hosting trend, or vice versa.
Section IV concludes the paper and proposes future work.
II. METHODS
The experiment was based on 400 popular search terms
from four different categories, including medicine, people,
science and technology. We collected 100 terms for each
category. Each term was queried against the official site of
Wikipedia article traffic statistics [8], which measures the page
views of a given article in a given month. Besides the total
number of views in a month, the site also provides daily views
in JSON format [8]. A program was developed to extract the
Wikipedia page views over a period of one month and to store
them in a database.
In the meantime, each search term was sent to popular
search engines to collect their daily hit count. Three search
engines were selected in this research, including Google,
Yahoo! and Bing. Programs were built to retrieve search
engines’ hit counts through their APIs. Google’s JSON/Atom
Custom Search API returns search results of a term through
RESTful requests from Google Custom Search [9]. The
returned results are presented in JSON or Atom format, which
can be parsed with a program.
Bing’s hit counts were retrieved in a similar way using the
Bing Search API, which returns the search results in XML or
JSON format [10]. We used Bing’s results to represent both
Bing and Yahoo!, since the latter is powered by Bing’s search
engine [11].
We queried the search terms against the search engines’
APIs and mined their Wikipedia page views. The results were
observed over a month and were stored in a database. Outliers
with 0 hits from a search engine were removed.
In order to analyze the relationship between the search hit
counts and the Wikipedia article traffic, the cross correlation of
the two was calculated. Cross correlation is a standard method
of estimating the degree to which two series are correlated
[12]. It is a measure of similarity of two series as a function of
the lag of one relative to the other. Given two N-element series
x[i] and y[i] where i=0,1,2...N-1, the cross correlation r at delay
d is defined as in equation (1),

? [ ] [ ]
v? [ ]

 v? [ ]

where mx is the mean of series x and my stands for the
average of series y. We used the x series to represent the search
engine’s monthly hit counts of a search term and we used the y
series for the number of views of the according Wikipedia
article. Cross correlations have been observed with different
days of delays assigned, ranging from -N to N. The maximum
cross correlation was then selected and stored together with its
delay for further analysis.
The pseudocode below illustrates the procedure of
calculating the strongest cross correlation, knowing the search
engine’s monthly hit counts of a term and its Wikipedia
monthly traffic.
MAX_CROSS_CORRELATION(x[], y[]){
 max_r = 0;
 FOR (delay = -N; delay <= N; delay++){
 Calculate the cross correlation r at delay
 IF (r > max_r){
max_r = r;
max_delay = delay;
 }
 }
 return [max_r, max_delay];
}
A cross correlation with 0 delay has the same value as the
Pearson correlation coefficient. A negative delay represents a
delay in the search engine hit count, while a positive delay
stands for a delay in the Wikipedia article traffic. For example,
Figure 1 shows Google’s monthly hit counts for search term
“Jared Cohen.” Figure 2 plots the series of the monthly views
of article “Jared Cohen.”
The cross correlation series with a maximum delay of 30 is
shown in Figure 3. One can observe that the strongest
correlation occurs at delay of about 1. In other words, the series
of Google hit counts from day 1 correlated with the Wikipedia
article traffic from day 2. Thus, for search term “Jared Cohen,”
the decline of Google’s hit count predicted the traffic of the
same titled article on Wikipedia.
Java was used to extract hit counts from search engines and
page views from Wikipedia. We wrote programs in C++ to
calculate and store the cross correlations between the two. At
the time of writing, Google’s Custom Search API provides 100
search queries per day for free with additional queries at a cost
[9]. The Bing Search API charges if there are more than 5,000
transactions per month [10].

views of Jared Cohen
III. RESULTS
We calculated the strongest cross correlations for terms in
the four categories and recorded them together with their
delays. The results are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5. The
horizontal axis represents the delay in days and the vertical axis
represents the strongest correlation caused by the according
delay. We can see from the figures, that most of the cross
correlations lie between 0.2 and 0.8 with delays ranging from
-20 days to 20 days.
Table I displays the average and the standard deviation of
the strongest cross correlations between search engine hits and
Wikipedia article views. We compare the results among terms
from different categories. Yahoo! and Bing show a stronger
correlation than Google for terms in medicine, science and
technology, while Google has a stronger correlation for queries
about people. Google, in general, has a larger standard
deviation than Bing and Yahoo!.
Terms in the medicine field result in the lowest average
cross correlation between the search engine hits and Wikipedia
page views. One of the reasons is that, unlike terms in other
categories, medical terms often have synonyms. For example,
bovine spongiform encephalopathy has a synonym of mad cow
disease, which is more commonly known. At the time of
writing, search term “bovine spongiform encephalopathy”

results in 444,000 Google hits, while query “mad cow disease”
returns 1,640,000 Web pages in Google. The former result fails
to represent the total number of pages on the Web regarding
the disease. One possible solution to this problem is to include
the hits of synonyms, which we will discuss in Section IV.
Table II shows the average and the standard deviation of
delays that result in the maximum cross correlation. It is
interesting to see that Bing/Yahoo! has an average positive
delay except for the science category, while Google has
negative delays for all categories. Comparing with Bing and
Yahoo!, Google has a larger standard deviation.

As mentioned in Section II, a positive delay in the
correlation represents a delay in the Wikipedia page views,
while a negative delay indicates a delay in the number of
websites. In other words, Wikipedia article traffic can be
predicted by the number of related Web pages, if there is a
positive delay. Similarly, the Web hosting trend can be
predicted by the growth/decline of the Wikipedia article views,
if there is a negative delay. Among all the search terms, Bing
and Yahoo! produce 53.3% positive delays and 46.7% negative
delays while calculating the cross correlation. On the other
hand, 62.7% of the cross correlations with Google were
generated by negative delays, as shown in Table III.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we presented a method to analyze the
correlation between search engines’ hit counts and Wikipedia’s
article traffic. We collected 400 popular search terms from
fields of medicine, people, science and technology. Each term
was sent to major search engines, including Google, Bing and
Yahoo!, to retrieve the number of related pages on the web. We
also extracted the number of views on the term’s Wikipedia
article. A month of data was collected and used to calculate the
cross correlations between the search engine hits and
Wikipedia page views. Most cross correlations lie between 0.2
and 0.8, which represent a moderate to strong positive
relationship.
We also analyzed the predicting trends between the hits on
the Web and the views in Wikipedia. 62% of the cross
correlations between Google and Wikipedia were caused by
negative delays, which indicates a leading trend in the
Wikipedia article traffic in predicting the inclination of Web
hosting. As mentioned in Section III, a term with synonyms
may cause inaccuracy in calculating the correlation. In the
future, we plan to use a synonym search API, such as [13], to
include the search engine hit counts returned by synonyms.
