# Cosine-Similarity-Application
Designed machine learning application that scores the similarity/dissimilarity 
between two text documents. There are 6 .txt files with text data, 1 .txt with 
stopwords, and 3 test versions written in Python. The Java version needs to be debugged!

Note:
Set "os.chdir("/YOUR/HOME/DIRECTORY/FOR/PROJECTS")" to your current working directory for Python, and 
place all .txt files in the same directory. Good Luck!
